# **WinMeter**

A personal project to acquire some experience with React + ViteJs and Firebase.

-----

## **To do**

- [ ] Refactor the code to TypeScript(Backend & Frontend)

- [ ] Use React and Sass(and maybe Bootstrap)

- [ ] Use Firebase Realtime Database

- [ ] use an API to capture CSGO matches* (Exists? Tracker.gg? possible solution: [WAU](https://steamcommunity.com/app/730/discussions/0/224446432330039286/)) 
    - PS: Probably I'll use CSGO [GameStateIntegration](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive_Game_State_Integration)

##### I'm going to add more goals :raised_eyebrow:
