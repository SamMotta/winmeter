# **WinMeter**

A personal project to acquire some experience with SQLite3 and Express.

## **Roadmap**

- [ ] Refactor/Modify the code to TypeScript

- [ ] Use React and Sass(and maybe Bootstrap) instead of Bootstrap and CSS

- [ ] Maybe use Firebase Realtime Databse instead of SQLite3

- [ ] use an API to capture CSGO matches* (Exists? Tracker.gg? possible solution [LINK](https://steamcommunity.com/app/730/discussions/0/224446432330039286/)) 
    - PS: Probably I'll use CSGO [GameStateIntegration](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive_Game_State_Integration)
- [ ] Create a Desktop GUI utilizing Tauri(Or Electron)

- [ ] Add more games (Rainbow Six: Siege/Extraction, Valorant, League of Legends)

- [X] Start using english to write the README.md instead of portuguese? :thinking:
